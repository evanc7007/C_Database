# C_Database
This is an SQLite clone project that I explored to further my knowledge of C and Storage Systems.

# Running the Program
Go to the directory that houses the executable. Running this command will compile and run the program, along with creating a data.db file.
  `if ($?) { gcc Database.c -o Database } ; if ($?) { .\Database data.db}`
